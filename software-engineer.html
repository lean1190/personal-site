                            What's the most important skill to develop as a software engineer?<br/>
                            Some say it's technical expertise and keeping up with trends.<br/>
                            <mark>I think the most important skill is communication.</mark><br/>
                            <strong>Let me tell you why.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Why communication?</h2>
                        <p>
                            As software engineers, we spend a lot of our time communicating with our colleagues
                            <ul class="disc">
                                <li>We have dailies, retros, and other meetings where we talk to developers, product managers, designers, and other stakeholders</li>
                                <li>We write pull requests and code reviews</li>
                                <li>We do pair and mob programming</li>
                                <li>We are constantly making and explaining technical decisions, and discussing approaches</li>
                                <li>We produce written and visual documentation like API docs and architectural diagrams</li>
                                <li>We onboard and mentor team members</li>
                                <li>We share and receive feedback</li>
                                <li>We constantly name variables, functions, classes, methods, and tests</li>
                            </ul>

                            <mark>If we cannot get our message through, the quality of our work suffers.</mark><br/><br/>

                            I struggled a lot with this during the first years of my career. I used to overwrite my colleagues' commits without asking when I thought my approach was better in quality.
                            As expected, not a lot of people wanted to work with me. I was so blindly convinced that I was "right", that I overlooked the harm I was causing.<br/><br/>
                            I was lucky enough to have a wake-up call from one of my colleagues who pointed this out. I was shocked and sad that I caused that.
                            On the bright side, that situation opened my eyes to everything else that happens in a software engineering team beyond writing code.
                            I started asking for feedback and paying attention to the way I communicated and how it landed.<br/>
                            <strong>This increased my value as a team member, improved my perception of my colleagues, and helped me become a team lead of a software engineer team.</strong>
                        </p>
