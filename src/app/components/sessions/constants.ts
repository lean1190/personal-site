Most Bootcamp grad developers struggle with self-confidence competing in a crowded market with many other talented developers. On top of this, not every Bootcamp teaches all the essentials to be part of a real software development team. That\'s where I come in. I will help you fill the gaps with knowledge from 10+ years of industry experience, solidify your skills, boost your confidence, and be prepared for your first job as a developer.'
