                            Taking care of a team is damn hard, doing it while also taking care of yourself is even harder.<br/>
                            During my time as a team lead, I had the chance to build an autonomous team, making sure we delivered awesome work together, without burning out. <br/>
                            <strong>Let me tell you how.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <h2>How it started</h2>
                        <p class="drop-cap">
                            When I started working as a software engineering team lead, I was panicking in excitement. It was the first time I was in such a role, I suddenly had to take care of people instead of code. I had no clue what I was doing, and I knew I wanted to do so many things, but I didn't know where to start.<br/><br/>
                            I was still taking care of my software engineer's tasks, and I was totally swamped with responsibilities and lack of time. Once I got aware of this, I started asking for help. I talked to fellow managers looking for inspiration, and knowledge. I knew that if I wanted to become a full-time leader, I had to let go of some of the responsibilities I was so attached to. Bit by bit, I delegated my old role to the rest of the team. It was not the easiest road for me, I had to let go of a lot of beliefs linked to my own ego and comfort zone. Beliefs like, “I should be the one making the decision”, or “I would do this in a better way”.<br/><br/>
                            <mark>Changing my own belief system was definitely worth the effort.</mark> The rest of the team was grateful for the change, not only because I could now spend more time supporting their growth, but also because I stopped being a bus factor — the amount of people that need to be hit by a bus for a project to stall —.<br/>
