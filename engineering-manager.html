                            Taking care of a team is damn hard, and it is even harder when we cannot express effectively our expectations, our values, and our beliefs.<br/>
                            During my time as a team lead, I learned how to tailor my communication for different personalities, resolved conflicts, had difficult conversations, and practiced the most effective ways to align a team around goals.<br/>
                            <strong>Let me share a story with you.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <h2>How it started</h2>
                        <p class="drop-cap">
                            When I started working as a software engineering team lead, I was panicking in excitement. It was the first time I was in such a role, I suddenly had to take care of people instead of code. I had no clue what I was doing, and I knew I wanted to do so many things, but I didn't know where to start.<br/><br/>
                            I was still taking care of my software engineer's tasks, and I was totally swamped with responsibilities and lack of time. On top of this, there was a team member that was underperforming. I never dealt with that situation before, and I didn't know what to do about it.
                            I reached out to fellow managers looking for inspiration, and knowledge. They suggested I give the underperforming team member the benefit of the doubt before making a statement I would regret. I took their advice, and I did exactly the opposite.<br/><br/>
                            <strong>I messed up hard.</strong> I had a 1:1 where I messed with his confidence, and his value to the team.<br/>
                            This team member pushed me to learn several management lessons in a couple of hours:

                            <br/><br/>

                            <strong># Lesson 1: Assume nothing</strong><br/>
                            As a manager, my perception of him might've been accurate, but that didn't mean I didn't need to listen to his point of view before making up my mind. Maybe I was missing a part of the story that I didn't let him tell me about.
                            <br/><br/>

                            <strong># Lesson 2: My words can unleash chaos, frustration, and stress</strong><br/>
                            The way I delivered my feedback was unexpected, hostile, and unempathetic. A recipe for disaster. I was not aware of how much impact my feedback had on that person's life.
                            <br/><br/>

                            <strong># Lesson 3: We are here to solve this together</strong><br/>
                            I had no plan, ideas, or even a suggestion on how to address this behavior. I shouldn't have put all the responsibility of dealing with the situation on his shoulders. This only created more frustration for both of us.

                            <br/><br/>
                            Fortunately, it was not too late. After that slap on my face, we had another 1:1, this time in completely different terms. I was prepared, mentally and practically. I apologized for my behavior in the previous meeting, acknowledged my fuck ups, and suggested we looked at the situation from a different angle. I had ideas on how to address the behavior, and I made sure he knew I was gonna help him go through the steps to get there. The changes were radically positive, and the person never had a relapse in performance again.

                        </p>

                            The engineering manager and team lead roles can be a rollercoaster of emotions, a never-ending line of internal and external conflicts, and a full house of self-doubt. <strong>But it can also be the most fulfilling, and enriching journey you can go through.</strong>
