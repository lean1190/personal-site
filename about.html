                            <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
                            <p>
                                I believe in a world where we all have less stress and more fulfillment in our lives, and I believe communication is the starting point to achieve this.
                                Any change in our lives requires communicating with ourselves and others to make it happen. This is where communication connects to my second passion, ideation.

                                <blockquote><em>I enjoy breaking the rules of the status quo, I enjoy finding new ways of doing things and lighting a spark in someone's eyes.</em></blockquote>

                                My passion for communication comes from my own need to land a message as I hoped. I was born with a short fuse, whenever someone would not get what I said I would get nuts. We can all agree that this is not ideal, and the more experience and influence I had, the more I needed to land my message respectfully and effectively. So I took a step back and reflected on my communication style, I decided I needed to do something different. I started reading and learning about the topic, starting from the book “Difficult Conversations” by Bruce Patton, Douglas Stone, and Sheila Heen, which I recommend to everyone. Trying to understand how people communicate sparked my curiosity and joy. Since then, I've been training myself to get better at delivering my message and moving towards a more assertive communication style. <br/><br/>

                                My interest in communication helps me support my ideation frenzy. I've always questioned how things are done because I believe there's always room for improvement. Change is not easy, it is usually slow and requires a lot of energy, which is why communication goes a long way here. I usually start with a simple method that I borrowed from Ricardo Semler, the “3 whys”. The “3 whys” is asking “why” 3 times to see if the argument resists the pressure. If it does and the argument is solid, there's probably little need for change given the current circumstances. If the argument doesn't hold, that's when my brain starts to spark.

                                        I believe the best results are achieved by having different perspectives and opinions on the table, to be able to craft compelling and holistic solutions.

                                        Transparent, honest, and clear communication are core to my person. In tough times, I prefer to talk about things instead of avoiding a conflict.

                                        I value relationships a lot, and it's important to me that we can create a meaningful relationship beyond a working transaction.
